### Rules

First, choose a player to create a tower with your 54 wooden Giant Mountain Blocks. Alternate between creating horizontal and vertical stories on your tower (three pieces placed side by side create one story). When construction is complete, your tower should be 18 stories tall.

Once the tower is created, players alternate removing a single block from the tower from anywhere below the highest complete story, and begin or add to a new story on top of the tower. Note, players must complete a story before expanding further.

- Using one hand, remove/stack one block per turn.
- Blocks may be tested to see how loosely or tightly they are in the tower prior to attempting to remove the block, and you don't have to pull the block you touch; however, a jarred block must be returned to its original position (also using one hand).
- Your turn ends when the next player touches a block or 10 seconds after you've placed your block on top of the tower.

### Winning the Game

- The last player to successfully add a piece to the tower before it is knocked over is the winner. Whoever knocked over the tower has the privilege of setting up the next round.
- The player who built the tower plays first, with play continuing clockwise.
