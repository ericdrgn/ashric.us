### What You Need

- Four people, two per team
- 22 party cups
- 2-6 table tennis balls
- Water or other liquids

### Determine Your Playing Scenario

- Tables fully assembled, players standing

- Tables assembled with only I leg, players sitting in chairs

- Use the social pong targets on your desired playing surface (for example, on a dining table)

**Note:** You can place the top cover layer over the target to utilize your social pong game as a side table. Beautiful, practical and fun!

### Get Ready, Get Set, Get Social, Pong

- Place the ten cups into the designated holes on the target.
- Fill each cup approximately 1/3 full of liquid.
- Place the two targets about 8 feet apart.
- Two Players stand by each target. The two players standing near the same target are on the same team.

### Who Throws First

A popular way to start the game is to have two opposing players look each other in the eye and without looking away or looking at the cups, shoot at the cups. The first team that makes a cup goes first. Teammates alternate turns until someone makes it. If both teams make it, you keep shooting.

### Playing the Game

- Each team will get two (2) shots for each turn, one shot per team member.
- If a player makes a cup, the other team should consume this cup and/or remove the cup from the table.
- The game continues in this way, with both players from one team taking a shot, followed by both players from the other team. The team that clears all the opposing team's cups first is the winner.
- If both players on a team sink his/her shot on the same turn, that team will get one (2) additional shots.
- If a ball bounces into a cup, it counts as two cups. The player that bounced the ball will choose the second cup to be removed from the table. HOWEVER, if they bounce, you have free reign to swat that shot away. Bouncing is a good strategy if a) you're good at it and b) the other team isn't paying attention.

### Let's End This

- After the last cup is scored, each player from the losing team has a chance to score the remaining cups.
- Each player shoots until they miss, the order in which this is done does not matter.
- If the losing team has remaining re-racking calls, they may be used now. If both players miss and there are remaining cups, the game is over.
- If the players manage to hit all remaining cups the game goes into a 3- cup overtime.

### Overtime

If a team hits the remaining cups during rebuttal, the game goes to overtime. Overtime consists of each team setting up 3 cups in a triangle format using water to fill them up. The team who hit the last cup prior to the rebuttal shoots first in overtime. Overtime is played like a normal game with the same rules applied.

### Backboard and In

If a player who does not have possession of the ball contacts the ball and as a result that ball enters one of his own cups, unintentionally acting as a backboard, that shot will be counted.

### Interference

- If players interfere prior to the ball's contact with a cup, a one-cup penalty will be imposed for the interference. The thrower who had his or her shot interfered with may choose the cup to be removed.
- If the offensive team bounces the ball, then the defensive team can interfere and swat the ball out of the air.
- Players may not contact the table while their opponents are shooting.
- Balls may not be interfered with while inside of a cup.
- If a player knocks over his or her own cups, those cups are to be counted as though sunk and removed from the table. They are not to be refilled or replaced. If the entire rack is knocked off the table, all cups are counted as hit. The exception is if this happens during reformation, in which case the cups are replaced.
- If cups are knocked over by any non-player, those cups are not counted as sunk, and are to be refilled and replaced in their appropriate positions on the table.
- If cups drift or are otherwise moved out of formation, those cups may be replaced in their appropriate positions upon request from the opposing team.

## ReRacking

Although the cups begin in a pyramid, they don't necessarily stay that way. As there are more holes in the pyramid from removing cups, it gets more difficult to make shots. To account for this, a team must "re-rack" at certain numbers of remaining cups in order to keep a compact shape at which their opponents can shoot. Each team gets 2 re-racks per game at any time. The shooting team can choose how they want their cups arranged. A standard rule of thumb is to take one with 6 cups remaining, and with 2 or 3 cups remaining. Reformation is to take place as soon as applicable, even in the middle of a turn.
