			<h1>About Us</h1>
			<p>
				Hello! We are the Dragons, and yeah we know that sounds spectacularly crazy but that is who we are through and through. 
				We are a couple of California kids who fell in love and decided that in everything we would find equal partnership.
			</p>
			<p>	
				Many facets of our lives began to take on that guiding principle so we changed our last name and the family of Dragons was born. 
				The name is pretty awesome but more importantly it lends to our fierce protection and love for those we care about. Some might say legendary... ;)
			</p>
			<p>
				Thanks for checking out our site, feel free to look around but we hope to see you in person soon!
